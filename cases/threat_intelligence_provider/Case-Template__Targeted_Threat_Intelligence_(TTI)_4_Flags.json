Those flags must be setted based on the following items:\n1. **Critical functions** of the `Entity`, since those CFs are important for the business logic.\n2. **Findings** from `case #1`, `case #2` and `case #3`. Think that you already have a landscape of the `Entity` from the `case #3`, use it for establish flags to capture.\n\n# Outcome\n\nThe outcome will be a list of flags that the RT must achieve during his exercise.",
