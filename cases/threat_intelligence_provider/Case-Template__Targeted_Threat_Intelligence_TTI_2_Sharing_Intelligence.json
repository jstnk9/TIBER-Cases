For achieve this, is necessary that both CTI teams work togheter to share knowledge. If the `Entity` hasn't CTI team, the sharing will be with the internal cybersecurity team or external cybersecurity team.\n\nSharing can be done in different formats, either technology structured format or reports made by `Entity`. When the sharing is finished, the TI provider must correlate the information received with previously stored intelligence to identify possible correlations from previous exercises.\n\n# Outcome\n\nThe outcome of this case is generated intelligence by the TI provider about those threats that the `Entity` did any investigation in the past. This intelligence is needed by the case #3.",

It is highly recommended to share the information in two ways\n- Using structured formats\n  - STIX objects\n  - MISP events\n  - Atomic Tests\n  - OpenIOC objects\n  - etc..\n- Reports documents made by `Entity`\n\nThe intelligence gathered can be useful for the next cases, since you will correlate information about threats observed by the `Entity` and you.",
